# Fireside
Fireside is a video chat application that allows users to chat around a virtual fireplace.

## Access & Instructions
Navigate to [erugg22.github.io](erugg22.github.io) in your browser. When the button appears, click Log in. You will then be taken to the login page. You may enter any email of standard email structure (abc@xyz.com) and any password greater than seven characters. The email or password you enter will not be saved as a database has not yet been configured to this application.

After logging in, you will be taken to the main video chat page. On the bottom left hand bar, enter a username (this is the name other users will see you as) and channel name (this name must be the same channel name that your friends have used). Then click the join button. You're in!

Features include: a virtual fireplace in the center of the screen that can be adjusted depending on the mood, a voice mute button, a video chat mute button, and a leave button.

## Inspiration
My inspiration for the theme of this video chat application was fond memories of talking around a campfire with friends and family. In times of isolation like these, it's meaningful to recapture those moments of comfort and warmth.
